abstract tree:

  type: 'machine-image',
  type: 'load-balancer',
  type: 'autoscale-group',
  type: 'access-rules',
  type: 'process', (can beprocess, docker or boot2docker)
  type: 'container',  generic hold all




abstract tree
analyzed tree
aggregate tree


system.js + definintions.js -> compiled.json
analysis                    -> analyzed.json
actual woring tree          -> aggregate.json

then use aggreagte to test against analyzed for deployment etc...


compiled + mappings + analyzed => aggregate

compare aggreage version


previously we wre directly editing aggreate

create tree for SUDC with mappings and make it work

when we do a build where does the data go? into the js definitions or into compiled or into aggregate ?
